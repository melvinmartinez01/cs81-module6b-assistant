1. What made your assistant “personal” to you?

My assistant is "personal" to me because I made it so that it feels like my personal butler (or my own JARVIS).
However, I made it more like a home assistant.

2. What challenges did you face using this?

The challenge I faced was visualizing how I wanted to set this program. When I first started, I set up the
"skeleton" up, something to start off, but the more I went back to look for certain strings, and methods, the
more I realized how I wanted my assistant to work.

3. Which method would you improve or expand?

I want to improve the whole program. I originally wanted to make it so that when you wake up, it would 
endearingly say Good morning, and when you get off from bed, it would ask if you want coffee to start brewing.
As you were to walk to the living room, that would be when HERBIE would have a conversation with me about how 
my wife wanted to me take the trash out and walk the dog BUT if I were to mock or say no, HERBIE would mentioned
that my wife asked for me to wash the dishes last night but that I had forgotten. Honestly I would really want to
explore the advancement of this particular project.
